# Experiment & play: hack-your-own game mechanics

You've been working hard learning about python now. And along the way you've been building a nice little game engine which has actually gotten quite sophisticated. The point of this section is really just to have fun, hack around, and let your creativity go where it wants! You have the chance to use the stuff that you've learned so far to experiment with and develop the simple game framework that we've been referring to.

There is an excellent & very easy tuturial on basic pyGlet structure which is [available at this link](http://simeonfranklin.com/talk/pyglet/slides.html#slide-1), which you should work your way through. Don't worry about making the game suggested in the final slide of the tutorial. [The official pyGlet documentation](http://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.2-maintenance/index.html) also provides a nice overview of all the different stuff you can do with pyGlet.

Do what you want. play around. make mistakes. do something crazy. try rendering the trails that the shapes take as the rotate and translate about the space, or perhaps try adding "sprites" (which are discussed in the [pyglet tutorial](http://simeonfranklin.com/talk/pyglet/slides.html#slide-1). if you want to experiment with sprites for example, then these little *.pngs should be easy to use as sprites ([manby](../python/hackSess/manby.png), [logan](../python/hackSess/logan.png), [essex](../python/hackSess/essex.png)) and might get your creative juices flowing.

# Other things to try

There's lots of other things that you could try and do with this code, and you should feel free to do what you want, but if you are stumped, then here are some suggestions:

* Figure out how to make classes for shapes other than triangles (e.g., pentagons, stars, hexagons, octagons, circles, ellipses, etc.)
* Experiment with different ways of making the objects move, or different ways of letting them interact with each other. For example, see if you can figure out how to write a function which will make the circles travel in different ways. For example, you could make them move:
    
    1. On circular trajectories
    
    2. Harmonically, based on how far the circle is displaced from the center of the graphics window
    
    3. On trajectories of the sort that you might expect for particles which have some kind of force interaction with the other particles in the system - e.g., momentum conserving collisions, harmonic interactions, Lennard-Jones interactions, or even gravitational fields. To incorporate forces, you will require an update scheme which incorporates forces - e.g., the so-called [velocity verlet scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration) is good way of doing this.
    
PyGlet has lots of options - for example it can implement sounds (you could make a bang when particles collide!), and it also has member function [which recognize keyboard keystrokes](http://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.2-maintenance/programming_guide/keyboard.html) to enable the design of simple games. If you are really ambitious, you could even imagining trying to build a spiffy version of the old classic "pong"!

Be creative - this is a chance to experiment & have fun and see what you can do.
